## Note: a new effect has been released.

Please check out [3D Anaglyph Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/222754) on the Unity asset store for a significantly better alternative implementation to this effect.  

This implementation suffers from numerous limitations, lacks customisation, and is generally very inaccurate.  This was an effect I wrote when I didn't fully understand how 3D anaglyphs are generated and hence involved a fairly na√Øve approach and a lot of guesswork.
